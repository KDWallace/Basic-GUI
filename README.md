# Basic GUI
 This is a small project that displays some of my knowledge regarding object orientation within Python. This is a basic gui creator that allows for buttons to be made and text boxes that allow for input. This may be improved further in the future to allow for in-program editing of buttons/boxes and possible integration with other projects such as the discord bot
